## P2P Communication
This project is a 'proof-of-concept' on establishing a P2P connection between two or more android-devices, and make them communicate using Multicast (UDP). This is accomplished by utilizing [WiFi P2P API](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifip2p.html).

### Prerequisites
 - [Android Studio Bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#)
 - [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
 - [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Getting started
- Install Java Development Kit
- [Set JAVA_HOME environment variable](https://github.com/bouvet-bergen/p2pcommunication/wiki/Set-JAVA_HOME-environment-variable)
- Install Android Studio Bundle
- Set up Android SDK with [Android Support Library](https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html)
- Install Git
- [Set the path to the Git executable](https://github.com/bouvet-bergen/p2pcommunication/wiki/Set-git-executable-path)
- (Check out the project from GitHub repository)

### FAQ
- Minimum SDK version: 14
- Target SDK version: 21

### Troubleshooting
- Android Virtual Devices does not support WiFi P2P so you have to test the app on a physical device.
